# Supermarket-Cashier
### Welcome to Andiâ€™s Supermarket Cashier Program
The Cashier Program is a system for self-service cashiers that enables them to input items, their prices, and the quantity ordered into a table, and subsequently provides the total amount to be paid.

#### Program Flow:
1. Users create a transaction on the program, one transaction at a time.
2. Users add product name, quantity and price in a single input
3. Users might change the product name, quantity and price without affecting each other (they might change the name without the quantities)
4. Users might delete products from the transaction list
5. Users might reset all the transaction and start from the beginning
